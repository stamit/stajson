This is a simple JSON library for C++.

- The interface is identical to C++ STL types.  JSONArray and JSONObject types
  are based on std::vector and std::map, and work the same way.

- Works with std::string strings and with iostreams.

- Intended to be used with UTF-8 encoded data or single-byte encodings.

- Does not preserve order of {} object members.

- No reference-counting or garbage-collection.

- Type errors are derived from runtime_error.

- NOT thread-safe.  Hold a lock before doing anything in a multithreaded
  environment.
